# Giftastic

This application demonstrates the use of a basic ajax api call to retrieve information from the giphy API. Users can click on a button to make a call to the giphy API which returns ten gifs that can then have their animations toggled by clicking the gif. Users may also create their own button to call new searches for the Giphy API.

## Deployment

Deployed on github pages at https://matthias61984.github.io/Giftastic/.

## To Use

Click one of the buttons at the top of the page to generate 10 gifs from Giphy based on the button's value. You can also build your own button (and later click it to search exactly as pre-made ones do) by using the form field on the right side of the page.

After you have generated the gifs, clicking on each one will toggle it between active and static.
