# Giftastic

This application demonstrates the use of a basic ajax api call to retrieve information from the giphy API. Users can click on a button to make a call to the giphy API which returns ten gifs that can then have their animations toggledby clicking the gif. Users may also create their own button by entering a value into th efield, then clicking on that button to make a call to the API with the value of th ebutton's input.
